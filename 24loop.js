Odd numbers are those that are not divisible by 2, leaving a remainder of 1. Your task is to calculate the sum of all the odd numbers up to a certain value chosen by you.

Write a program to print the sum of odd numbers up to N.

Tips:

1. Remember, odd numbers are those that are not divisible by 2, leaving a remainder of 1.
2. Pay attention to calculating the sum accurately.
3. Ensure the correctness of the range of numbers included in the sum.

Test Case1:
Input:
20
Output:
100 */
const input = require("readline-sync");
let n = input.questionInt("enter the number:");
let i = 1;
let s = 0;
     while(i<n)
{
     if(i%2!=0)
{
         s = s + i;
         
}

         i = i + 1;
}
         console.log(s);
